                <p>A universal truth that can apply to any story is: humanity may have so much knowledge on so many things, yet we refuse to use that knowledge and do extremely dumb things. This is demonstrated in “This is not who we are” because the knowledge of humanity has changed and no one can agree on anything.</p>

                <p>The first way the theme is demonstrated in the story is the narrator mentions her culture and how it has fallen since her childhood, because of modernization. In the story, the author writes: “No. I am simply an Arab-American in deep need of cultural uplift to balance the ugliness that has cast a deep shadow over our days.” (Nye, p. 4) In the time of the quote, the main character is crying because of a song she heard on the radio that related to her past culture. She has had a lack of her own culture within her own life throughout her mature years as an adult and the song brought her memories of her culture from when she was a child. She misses the feeling that her culture gave her and the protection it gave her from the darker parts of the world. In the story, the author writes: “Arabs and Israelis who come together in Maine and Jerusalem for deepened dialogue and greater understanding. Their gatherings are not easy. They cry and fear and worry.” (Nye, p. 16) This quote demonstrates that Arabs and Israelis are scared most likely because of how the world around them has changed and how different people perceive things that are different to them. They are worried that greater powers may harm their culture.</p>

                <p>The second way the theme is demonstrated is that the narrator mentions that humans are full of knowledge but still stupid. In the story, the author writes: “Yes. I breathe deeply, closing my eyes. And how are we educated human beings so old and so stupid?” (Nye, p. 30) This quote demonstrates the theme by saying that human beings are “so old”, therefore gaining lots of knowledge, but “so stupid”, saying that with all the knowledge we have, we don’t use it. In the story, the author writes: “It’s rumored he’s also the poet most often read aloud on the radio in Afghanistan. Open The Soul of Rumi anywhere and find something helpful. On page 158: “Why am I part of this disaster, this mud hole for donkeys?” Later in the same poem, “I ask / a flower, ‘How is it you are so wise so / young?’” (Nye, p. 29) This quote metaphorically mentions levels of knowledge between humanity and a flower. It says humanity is a “mud hole for donkeys”, symbolizing how much knowledge we have but are still stupid in many ways. Then later in the poem, the author of the poem (in the poem) writes: “I ask / a flower, ‘How is it you are so wise so / young?’”. This symbolizes that a flower may not have much knowledge, but it chooses not to be stupid like humanity.</p>

                <p style="width: 200%;">Humanity has access to lots of knowledge, yet we refuse to use that knowledge, and instead, argue about everything even when the answer is right in front of us. Humanity needs to learn to utilize the knowledge they have been given.</p>
